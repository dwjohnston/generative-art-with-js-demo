# Generative Art with JavaScript

## What I'm trying to achieve with this talk

- Something a bit different, a bit fun. 
- We'll talk about some technical specifics
- But otherwise we'll talk about how a side project like this can be useful for your own technical development. 
    - For example: 
        - Deploying a website
        - Data structures

## How I got here

I used to be into electronic music.
